OurBricks-Blender
-----------------

OurBricks-Blender is an addon for Blender which makes it easy to
interact with OurBricks.  The first feature is making it easy to
import from and export to OurBricks directly within Blender.


Installation
------------

Installation should be as easy as dropping the source code in your
Blender addons directory:

<blender-install-dir>/<blender-version>/scripts/addons/ourbricks_blender

To enable the addon: 
1. Open Blender and navigate to the Addon options via File > User Preferences. 
2. Select the 'Add-Ons' tab, select'Import-Export' on the left. 
3. Find 'Import-Export: OurBricks for Blender' and tick the checkbox on the right. 

The addon is now enabled and you should see the 'OurBricks Browser' to the left when 
in 'Object Mode'. 

To always enable the addon, click the 'Save As Default' button in the user preferences 
window after ticking the checkbox.


Using this script
-----------------

Import a model from OurBricks into Blender:

1. Navigate to a model page at OurBricks.com. For instance: 
http://ourbricks.com/viewer/4791b6c9234cac001f6424e2e2603ad4
2. Locate the "Download" button (keep in mind that only not-for-sale models will have this) and click it.
3. Now right click the download URL and copy it
4. Back in Blender you paste the URL into the "OurBricks Browser" section and hit "Import"

You model should now appear in Blender
