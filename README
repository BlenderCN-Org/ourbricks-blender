OurBricks-Blender
-----------------

OurBricks-Blender is an addon for Blender which makes it easy to
interact with OurBricks.  The first feature is making it easy to
import from and export to OurBricks directly within Blender.


Installation
------------

Installation should be as easy as dropping the source code in your
Blender addons directory:

<blender-install-dir>/<blender-version>/scripts/addons/ourbricks_blender

To enable the addon, open Blender and navigate to the Addon options
via File > User Preferences. Select the 'Add-Ons' tab, select
'Import-Export' on the left. Find 'Import-Export: OurBricks for
Blender' and tick the checkbox on the right. The addon is enabled and
you should see the 'OurBricks Browser' to the left when in 'Object
Mode'. To always enable the addon, click the 'Save As Default' button
in the user preferences window after ticking the checkbox.
